# missing-semester

Learning technologies in CS what I haven't learned during my master education.

Main idea for this repo - make perfomance testing of my knowlege, so I aim to make not only unit tests for alrogithms or programs, but also perfomance testa on different approaches to do the same things.

Also this is my open knowledge base in CS. Work in progress...
